## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Jump Game" project aims to provide users with an engaging arcade game based on the popular mobile game "Gofur Jump". The application brings the gameplay to desktop devices, allowing players to control the game using the keyboard and mouse. The objective of the game is to jump over as many logs as possible.

### Features Description:

- **Game Modes:** The game will be available in two modes: classic "Jump" mode and "Survival" mode.
- **Controls:** Users can control the character using the keyboard and mouse.
- **Leaderboard:** A ranking system that allows players to compete for the highest scores.
- **Customization:** Ability to customize the appearance of the character and game environment.
- **Statistics:** Track player progress, including the number of logs jumped over and points scored.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Game Modes:** Users can choose between classic "Jump" mode and "Survival" mode.
- **Controls:** Intuitive control of the character using the keyboard (arrow keys or WASD) and mouse (clicks).
- **Leaderboard:** A scoreboard displaying the top scores of players.
- **Customization:** Options to customize the appearance of the character and game environment.
- **Statistics:** Store data regarding player progress.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Game Smoothness:** Efficient algorithms to ensure smooth gameplay.
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly and intuitive interface.
- **Compatibility:** The game should work on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## User Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of the Interface:

- _Home Page:_ Main menu with options to start the game, customize settings, and view the leaderboard.
- _Game Screen:_ Game view with the character, logs to jump over, and the current score.
- _Customization Screen:_ Options for selecting the appearance of the character and game environment.
- _Leaderboard Screen:_ List of top scores with an option to view friends' scores.

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores game data, including:

- **Player Data:** Information about progress, scores, and customization settings.
- **Leaderboard Data:** List of top scores of players.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on a layered structure, where:

- **Model:** Manages game logic and data handling.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Flask (Python).
- **Database:** SQLite (storing player and score data).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for game logic, interface, and data management.
- _Coding Style:_ Use of modularity, readability, and code comments.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of game functions, such as jumping and collision detection.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure components work correctly together.
- **User Interface Tests:** Test user interactions on various devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Assess game performance with different settings and object counts.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each function of the application.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing found bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixes, publishing on platforms accessible to users.
- **Deadlines:** Specify dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels with users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on needs and user feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Divide work into specific tasks (e.g., implementing game logic, interface, testing).
- **Deadlines:** Specify time needed for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on working hours or development team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, potential fees for external services, technical support.
